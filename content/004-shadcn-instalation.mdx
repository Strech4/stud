# Install ShadCN UI
Run the init command to create a new Next.js project or to setup an existing one:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

> Note You can use the -d flag for defaults i.e new-york, zinc and yes for the css variables.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init -d
```

### Configure components.json
You will be asked a few questions to configure components.json:

```bash
Which style would you like to use? › New York
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Zinc
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / yes
```

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

The command above will add the Button component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```tsx Home.tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
 
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
