# Install Next.js

To create a new Next.js project, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

```bash
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
```

Start app

```bash
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

# Install Tailwind CSS
Install tailwindcss and its peer dependencies via npm, and then run the init command to generate tailwind.config.ts
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

### Configure tailwind.config.ts
Add the paths to all of your template files in your tailwind.config.ts file.

```tsx
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",

    // Or if using `src` directory:
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

### Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS
Add the @tailwind directives for each of Tailwind’s layers to your globals.css file.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### Start your build process

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Start using Tailwind in your project
Start using Tailwind’s utility classes to style your content.

```tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold underline">
      Hello world!
    </h1>
  )
}
```

# Install Framer-motion
Framer Motion requires React 18. Install framer-motion from npm
```bash
npm i framer-motion
```
Once installed, you can import Framer Motion via framer-motion.
```tsx
// React
import { motion } from "framer-motion"

// React Server Components
import * as motion from "framer-motion/client"
```

# Install ShadCN UI
Run the init command to create a new Next.js project or to setup an existing one:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

> Note You can use the -d flag for defaults i.e new-york, zinc and yes for the css variables.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init -d
```

### Configure components.json
You will be asked a few questions to configure components.json:

```bash
Which style would you like to use? › New York
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Zinc
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / yes
```

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

The command above will add the Button component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
 
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
