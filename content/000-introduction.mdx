# Getting Started

In this article, I share my components for free to help you build modern, responsive, and performant interfaces.

## Introduction

I use **Next.js**, **Framer Motion**, **Tailwind CSS**, and sometimes **ShadCN UI** to create flexible and elegant components.

<Note>
    I always use **TypeScript** in my projects to ensure better maintainability and robustness of the code.
</Note>

## Free and Commercial Use

All my components are completely **free to use, even for commercial projects**. You’re welcome to integrate them into your own websites or applications, without any limitations. If you happen to use them in a project, I’d love to see how they’ve contributed to your work! Feel free to share your creations with me, as it would be great to see these components in action across different projects.
